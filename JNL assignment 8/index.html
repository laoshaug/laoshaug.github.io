    <h2>Residents of Syracuse are calling for immediate action as elevated lead levels raise health worries and calls for a state of emergency, despite city officials' promises of clean drinking water.</h2>

    <!-- First Half of the Story -->
    <p>Darlene Medley says she can’t trust the water coming from the faucets at her Syracuse, New York, home if she wants to keep her children safe – even as the city says it’s safe.</p>
    <p>She is worried the lead pipes might poison her 8-year-old twin boys, just like the paint from the walls at her former apartment did years ago.</p>
    <p>“It’s terrifying,” Medley, 44, told CNN. “I must now keep bottled water, not only for them to drink but also to cook.“I know people say you can boil water, and I understand all that, but you’re talking to a family that has already been affected by lead poisoning,” she said.”</p>
    <p>Medley, along with other residents and advocates in Syracuse, began questioning the water quality at their homes in August, when the city’s water department said it found elevated lead levels at some homes during routine checks. City officials have since said testing problems led to faulty results and reassured residents the water is safe, but some remain skeptical.</p>

    <!-- Remaining Story -->
    <p>Exposure to lead has been linked to adverse effects on children’s health, including damage to the brain and nervous system that could manifest as lower IQ, learning and behavior difficulties, hearing loss, speech problems, and impaired growth and development.</p>
    <p>The situation in Syracuse recalls the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, where in 2014 officials began to use the Flint River as a water source but did not treat the water properly with anti-corrosive agent, causing lead from old pipes and other toxins to leach into the water supply.</p>
    <p>Nationwide, an effort of at least $15 billion is underway to replace lead service lines within 10 years, though advocates and federal officials have estimated it could cost tens of billions of dollars more.</p>
    <p>Erik Olson, a senior strategic director for the climate advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council, spoke Tuesday at a rally outside Syracuse City Hall, calling on authorities to address what concerned residents say is a drinking water crisis.</p>
